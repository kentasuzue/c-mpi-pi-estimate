# c-mpi-pi-estimate
The MPI (Message-Passing Interface) program, written in C, for a distributed memory system demonstrates the allocation of work to multiple processes and combining the work from multiple processes.  The program estimates π with a Monte Carlo method. Each process simulates darts that are tossed randomly at a square dartboard with a size of 2 feet per side.  The overall ratio of darts that hit inside a 1 foot radius circle in the square dartboard is about π/4.
